# Visual-Attention
Working MATLAB model of a computational neuroscience experiment based on Posner's paradigm on visual attention.

In this study, subjects are asked to concentrate on the center of the screen and maintain focus without any interruption. A point on the screen is cued with a certain stimulus for a short duration of time, such that it appears as a flash. Afterwards a target is shown on the screen and users have to press a key denoting valid or invalid locations i.e., target being present on the location of the cue or not. Posner found that for a valid cue, the reaction time was lower than that of the invalid cue. He interpreted these topics in terms of “attentional spotlight” which focuses on a certain region in space that shifts with a finite and measurable speed.
